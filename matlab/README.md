#MiniNet

Hello, this is matlab version of MiniNet.

It is not big and powerful, but has some good features, such as concise, because it has few shells. Hmm...

if you want to have a try, please goto Test directory and run `test_layers.m` or `over_fit_small_data.m`. 
 Or goto Example/mnist directory and run `mnist_example.m`. have fun~
